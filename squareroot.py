# My program takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root

x = decimal(input("Please enter a positive number: "))
# x is the value input by the user.
# the input is converted in decimal so the program can perform floating point arithmetic. https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/stdlib2.html#decimal-floating-point-arithmetic
