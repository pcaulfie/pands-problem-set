# My program takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root

x = float(input("Please enter a positive number: "))
# x is the value input by the user, converted into decimat using float data type, ref https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html 
print(sqrt(x))
